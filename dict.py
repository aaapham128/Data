# Create a dictionary with KNOWN values

answers = {} #curly brackets means dictionary

# Create an array of survey questions
survey = [] #square brackets means lists

# Create an array of keys for each survey question
# Hint: All keys must be unique

# Use a for loop to go through the questions in your survey
# If your survey has 4 questions, go through it 3 times

# Inside the for loop, prompt the user for response for each question
# Set their answers equal to the response(their answers are the "values")

#print the answers
